# Pupose

To understand exactly how vue works and how libraries like [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org), and [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) help improve the coding. But it was very difficult to find the examples for vue which will go from the simple app without vuex or router and then introducing these library to show how they solve it. So, I hope this repository will be able show how these libraries help improve the development in vue.

Right now this repository has three branches split in three branches.

- master branch (which will have vue + vuex + vue-router implementation)
- todo-redux (As name suggests it is vue + vuex implementation)
- vanilla-vue (Todo with only vue)

# Development

Future updates to the repository will be done only on the master branch.

# Disclaimer

This is not the only way to work with these libraries, there are different ways to achieve the same thing.
